# Purpose: 
#
# This snippet includes functions useful in analyzing and visualizing ROC Curves. 
# It can be particulary useful because it automatically calculates the
# optimal prediction threshold. The visualizations help see what observations are type 1 or 2 error too.
# 
# Highlights:
#   print variable text strings (in, say, a ggplot title) using base::sprintf()
